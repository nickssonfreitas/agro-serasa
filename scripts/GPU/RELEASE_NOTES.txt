- GRID 6.1

  The Nvidia GRID 6.1 driver (390.57) may show intermittent issues after
  it is installed on CentOS 7.5 (kernel 3.10.0-862.2.3.el7.x86_64) and
  RHEL 7.5 (kernel 3.10.0-862.2.3.el7.x86_64) for the first time.
  This behaviour has only been observed on the g3.16xlarge instance size.
  An instance reboot is recommended after installing the GRID driver in
  order to prevent this issue from happening.
